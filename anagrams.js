// Problem: Group Anagrams
// Write a function that takes an array of strings and groups the anagrams together. An anagram is a word formed by rearranging the letters of another word. The output should be an array of arrays, where each inner array contains words that are anagrams of each other.

// Example:
// groupAnagrams(["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"]);
// // Output: [["eat", "tea", "ate"], ["tan", "nat"], ["bat"]]

// Requirements:
// Create a function named groupAnagrams.
// The function should accept a single array of strings as a parameter.
// It should return an array of arrays, where each inner array contains words that are anagrams of each other.
// Constraints:
// The input array may contain words of varying lengths and characters.
// The order of the groups and the order of words within each group does not matter.
